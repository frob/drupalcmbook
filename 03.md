# What is CMI

As I said in the history chapter, CMI stands for Configuration Management Initiative. CMI was the project within the [D8] project to make configuration sane and standard for developers.

## Configuration Entities

One of the primary results of CMI was the ability to create configuration entities. [D7] saw the creation of the Entity system for content, D8 expanded on that consept for configuration. There are several key differences between configuration and content entities. 

### Configuration Entities are stored in files

Unlike conent entities, configuration entities are stored in files. They are cached in the db for ease of access, but they are stored long term in files. These files are normally stored in [storage location]. 

> Notice that I said "These fiels are normally stored." These configuration files can be stored nearly anywhere. This allows for some very intesting configuration management and development strategies. More on this later on.

This gives the developer the ability to store this configuration in the site's repository.

### Not meant for end users

It should go without saying, but, configuration entities are not a place to store content. Content Entities are used to store content, end users should be writing content. Therefore, end users will in most cases not be making configuration entities.
