# Who wrote this book?

This book is open source, I hope that there will soon be others listed here. But for now, this book was written by me Frank Robert Anderson.

@TODO ask someone else to write this part

# Who is this book for?

When I first set out to write this book, I was telling myself that this book is for the community. Now I understand my audience much better, because the the audience for this book is me. Once I figured that out the writing of the book started to come much more smoothly.

# Who should read this book?

This book is intended for people who are familiar with [D7] or older and are looking to start building sites for [D8]. This book is not for someone who is looking for a hard core in depth look into [D8] because we will only be examining, what I consider to be the biggest improvement in [D8], the configuration management system. If you are not comfortable building a site in [D7] or [D6], then you might want to read another book or just dive in and start building a site with [D8]. After you have done that then come back to this book.

## What is this book about?

This book is exclusively about working with the configuration management system to build sites or develop modules/plugins for [D8]. I will not be going over Drupal basics in depth. If you do not know what a node, entity, field, block, taxonomy, or view is with regard to Drupal, then you will likely be a bit lost through some of this book.

This book will explore what the configuration management system is, how it was conceived, what problems it solves, and how to utilize it in a site building/development workflow. The book will be divided into three parts:

- Pedantic
  This is where I will tell you what configuration management is and why it is important.
- Reference
  This is where I will tell you about how to use configuration management in specific  functional detail.
- Tutorial
  This is the section with specific workflow based how tos.

With this book having three sections that all cover the same thing there is going to be some repatetition, this is by design. Different people learn in different ways. I expect some to skip to the reference parts or only use the Tutorial section. In order for those parts to be complete, they will have to contain the same information.

# About the book

This book is also an open source project. I hope it will catch on and I will get further contribution to the book from the Drupal community. I am selling this book, both in print and ebook versions. This is because I spent a long time writing it and thought it would be the easiest and best way to allow those who want to give back or those who would prefer a paper copy to get it. The source for this book is available on github, and pull requests are welcome. Once there is more than just me contributing I will add a contributors page.
