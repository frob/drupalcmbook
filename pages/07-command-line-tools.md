Drupal's standard comand line tool for development has always been drush (the drupal shell). With all the other new things to come to drupal there are new command line tools to learn too. DrupalConsole and Composer are two new (to drupal) tools for building sites and scafolding code. I will only be going over Drush and DrupalConsol in this book because (as far as I know) Composer has nothing to do with the configuration management system in Drupal.

There will be some overlap in functionallity, but I don't consider them to be competing tools. They both serve differnet purposes.
