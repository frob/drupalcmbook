## How do I ... Develop

With [D7] you had few choises as to where to put your code: modules, themes, or profiles. [D8] added plugins, services, containers, and more, as options for places to put code. They all have an intended purpose.

All the in's and out's of [D8] development will not be covered here. This will be focused on manipulation of configuration objects. I will not be going in depth on modules, plugins, or when to use one or the other. That is something that will need to be in a different book. This is just an overview of how to do development things with configuration objects in whatever code you end up writing.

### Define a config entity

### Create a form for setting a config entity

### Package default config

### Package custom node/entity type

### Package a view

### Override base settings

### Theme stuff
